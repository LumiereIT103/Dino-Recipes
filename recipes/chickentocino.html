    <p>
        Chicken Tocino is one of the components to “Tocilog” – one of the Filipino brekkie stars! It’s a dreamy combo of tocino, sinangag (garlic fried rice made from leftover rice), and itlog (egg, sunny-side up or scrambled – your choice). A perfect way to start your day!

Oh, and when you dig into chicken tocino, don’t forget the extras: atchara (pickled papaya), vinegar dipping sauce (my personal fave), and slices of cucumber and tomato.

    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>500 g chicken thigh fillet cut into pieces</li>
        <h3>Marinade:</h3>
        <li>12 cloves garlic chopped</li>
        <li>2/3 cup brown sugar</li>
        <li>½ cup canned pineapple juice</li>
        <li>3 tbsp soy sauce</li>
        <li>3 tbsp white vinegar</li>
        <li>3 tsp salt</li>
        <li>2 tsp ground black pepper</li>
        <li>Few drops of red food coloring optional</li>
        <h3>Others (to serve)</h3>
        <li>Garlic fried rice</li>
        <li>Fried eggs</li>
        <li>Vinegar dipping sauce</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Instructions</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine the chicken with the rest of the marinade ingredients in a bowl. Mix well and marinate overnight.</li>
        <h3>The next day:</h3>
        <li>Heat a non-stick skillet or frying pan over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Add a little cooking oil to the pan.</li>
        <li>Place the marinated chicken in the pan, along with some of the marinade.</li>
        <li>Cook the chicken, turning occasionally, until it caramelizes and sticky. This usually takes about 10-15 minutes, depending on the thickness of the chicken pieces and the heat of your stove.</li>
        <li>If the sauce dries out while cooking, you can add a little water or pineapple juice to keep it moist and prevent burning.</li>
        <li>Once cooked through and caramelized, chicken tocino is typically served hot with garlic fried rice and fried eggs, with a vinegar dipping sauce on the side.</li>
